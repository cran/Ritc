# This file contains the input parameters for ITC fitting to one to one binding model
# This file is read in as a csv file; keep the format when modifying
# Three groups of data are listed below for input
# The first group is one line, for the file name of the csv file exported from Origin7 
# The second group is experimental set parameters including
#	P0: protein concentration in cell in mM (the binding partner in cell even if it is not a protein)
#	L0: ligand concentration in cell in mM (the binding partner in syringe even if it is not ligand)
#	Asyr: ligand cocentration in syringe in mM (the binding partner in syringe even if it is not ligand)
#	V0: the volume of the ITC cell in ml
# The third group is estimates of the fitting parameters including
#	K: the binding constant in 1/M
#	DH: the binding enthalpy in cal/mole
#	N: the binding stoichiometry ratio, ligand/protein
#	HD: heat of dilution in ucal for each injection
# 
# q=list(P0=0.03, L0=0, Asyr=0.6, V0=1.4195); 
# p=list(K=100000, DH=-16000, HD=0.1, N=1);
